# Java Assignments

In this repository you can find my created Java Assignments from the Sogyo Traineeship. This traineeship starts with the basics and the assignments found here are part of the first 2 weeks.
As you can imagine some of these are very basic, e.g. the leap year assignment, but by the end of the second week they get a little more complex, see the Sudoku Solver or the unfinished Ray Tracer.
In the rest of this readme you'll be able to find short intro's to the individual assignments, these are in order of creation.

## Leap year (Beginner)
Write a basic program that calculates if the input year is a leap year or not.
## Lists (Beginner)
Deal with lists & arrays and how to manipulate them.
## Hangman (Beginner)
Create a hangman program that you can play in the terminal.
## Quote of the day (intermediate)
Based on an immutable String List deal with static and non-static variables and methods to print out a quote of the day
## Roborally (intermediate)
Store runnables in an array to be able to have "robots" follow assignments in your provided order.
## Fractional Calculation (intermediate)
Implement functions related to fractions and how to deal with objects.
## Decision tree (intermediate)
Read a text file and based on the input create a decision tree you can run through in the CLI.
## Exceptional users (intermediate)
Create a basic regex checker for passwords and create your own exceptions.
## Nim (intermediate)
Implement te game Nim to be played against te computer or a second player.
## Sudoku Solver (advanced)
Based on a string input have the computer solve the sudoku for you. The linear programming, simplex method, has been implemented to solve sudoku's within 500 milliseconds.
## Ray Tracer (advanced)
A Ray tracer was created, not fully finished (especially the code can get some clean up, not done due to time constraints and going on in the traineeship to new assignments) 
Implement how rays of light reflect (if they intersect) on orbs in 3d and fall on a screen from the point of view of an observer.
